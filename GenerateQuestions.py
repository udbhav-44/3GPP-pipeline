        - The questions should be such that their answers can be detailed reports, this means that the answering those questions would require in depth research and reasoning
        - The questions should be related to the following domains: finance, economics, law, markets, technology, politics, environment, consumers etc. Questions can also be multidisciplinary, combining facts from multiple domains.
        - Try to make the questions as diverse as possible, but you must not deviate from the original query given. 
        - The questions should be *at least* 20 words long
        - Output the questions according to the schema:
        {

        "question2": "...",
