        - The questions should focus on topics related to 3GPP technical specifications, mobile communication systems, protocols, and network architectures.
        - Questions should encourage detailed answers, requiring in-depth research and reasoning.
        - Make the questions diverse but ensure they remain relevant to the core topics of 3GPP and communication technologies.
        - The questions should be *at least* 20 words long.
