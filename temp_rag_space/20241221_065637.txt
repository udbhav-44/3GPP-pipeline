Key features of task management software
----------------------------------------

### Automation

Automation features in task management software allow users to save time and energy on repetitive, time-consuming or redundant tasks. Another benefit of automating tasks is that errors are reduced. While most task management software offers automation, some automations are more customizable than others.

### Collaboration

One of the major advantages of using task management software is that it provides some structure for team collaboration. Users can receive information and share updates with their coworkers and managers through comments, real-time chat and other tools.

### Time tracking

Built-in time tracking tools allow users to stay on top of task schedules, track billable and non-billable hours and forecast any hurdles to task completion.

### Views

With top task management software, you can choose from a variety of views — such as lists, cards and kanban boards — to choose the one that best suits each project. Different views provide effective and simple layouts for each stage of the task.

Benefits of working with task management software
-------------------------------------------------

Task management software is becoming increasingly popular, as it helps teams and individuals stay organized and on schedule to complete their tasks. Here are some of the top benefits of using task management software:

*   **More mental bandwidth:** With task management software, users can focus on other aspects of their work. Automatic notifications and reminders ensure users don’t have to stress about missed deadlines.
*   **Time savings:** Forgotten tasks and unclear expectations can often lead to extra work, eating away at your valuable time. With task management software, you keep your to-do list organized so you can stay on top of your schedule to get work done.
*   **Improved processes:** Certain task management software features, such as milestones and Gantt charts, help users monitor progress to determine if they are on track to finish their tasks or whether they need to adjust their working plans.
*   **Better visibility:** Teams benefit from using task management software by gaining better visibility and trust. Users can track the progress of tasks assigned to other teammates and their participation toward team goals.

How do I choose the best task management software for my business?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether you are a large enterprise or a solo user, you could benefit from task management software, as it provides the structure to organize, assign and track tasks. When choosing the right task management tool, you need to consider what problem you are looking to solve and how the software helps you solve that problem.

Some of the most important things to consider include the quality of the user interface, collaboration tools, pricing structure and unique features. If your working model requires you to share tasks or projects with clients, choose software that offers these features. Keep in mind that not all task management software allows you to share tasks with non-users like clients or guests.

The user interface must also be intuitive, so your team doesn’t face a steep learning curve. Most task management software offers a kanban-style dashboard; however, some solutions are based on a spreadsheet model. You must also consider whether you want a web or cloud-based system or an on-premises version.

While top task management software should offer basic features such as project views and subtasks, you’ll also want to assess each tool’s unique features. Unique features could include two-factor authentication, real-time collaboration, task dependencies or any particular feature that is a must-have for your business.

Lastly, you want to consider the price point. Ideally, you want to test the software before you make the decision, so if there is a free version or free trial available, you should take advantage of that opportunity. Most free task management software lacks advanced features, but you will still be able to get a feel for the user interface and the tool’s core functions.

Methodology
-----------

To determine the best task management tools, we researched an extensive collection of task management software and tested out many of them using free accounts and free trials. We also consulted customer reviews, product documentation, software specifications, pricing structure, third-party integrations, unique features and several other metrics to compile this list of top task management software for 2024.
