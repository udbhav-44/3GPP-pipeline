{"query":"MIMO technology in 6G"}

Agent Tools RAW Output:


Reflections Output
Error: NameError("name 'top_5_specs' is not defined")
 Please fix your mistakes.

Reflections Output
Reasoning: The assistant attempted to fetch 3GPP specifications related to MIMO technology in 6G but encountered an error. The response did not provide any information or analysis on the topic, which is critical given the user's request for a comprehensive report. The assistant should have provided a detailed analysis based on existing knowledge or alternative sources while ensuring to cite relevant information. The lack of a successful fetch means the response is incomplete and lacks the necessary technical details, numerical analysis, and regulatory considerations. Therefore, the response does not meet the user's requirements and fails to provide a solution.
Score: 2
