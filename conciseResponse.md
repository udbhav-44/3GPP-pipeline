The latest MIMO specifications from 3GPP, particularly in Release 18, include:

1. **Massive MIMO Enhancements**: Focus on advanced codebook design for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and optimized sounding reference signals for Time Division Duplex (TDD) systems. This supports coherent joint transmission from multiple transmission/reception points (multi-TRPs).

2. **Channel State Information (CSI)**: Enhancements for mobility to provide accurate CSI estimates, crucial for higher-speed scenarios.

3. **Unified Transmission Configuration Indicator (TCI)**: A framework tailored for millimeter-wave (FR-2) multi-TRPs to reduce beam switch latency.

4. **Over-the-Air (OTA) Testing**: New methodologies and requirements for testing MIMO capabilities in New Radio (NR) User Equipment (UE).

These specifications are part of ongoing developments aimed at improving network performance and efficiency in 5G and beyond. For detailed specifications, refer to documents like 3GPP TS 38.201 and TS 38.202.
