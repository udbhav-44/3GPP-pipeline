Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula is expressed as:

\[ E = mc^2 \]

Where:
- \( E \) is the energy (in joules),
- \( m \) is the mass (in kilograms),
- \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \) meters per second).

This formula indicates that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa, establishing a fundamental principle in physics. It has significant implications in nuclear physics, explaining the energy produced in nuclear reactions, such as in atomic bombs and nuclear power plants.
