    1. Now simply change the markdown file to include the image at the appropriate place, by mentioning a link to it at the appropriate place.

    4. Do not create a graph if in case one of the value is not present for a source. 
    5. Use various different types of graphs available in matplotlib.

    DO NOT GENERATE GRAPHS WHICH ARE NOT INSERTED IN THE MARKDOWN

    1. Use your tools to generate the chart.
    2. Use a non-interactive backend. For example, (matplotlib.use('Agg')). 
    3. Do not view the chart. This is to make sure we avoid this error: NSWindow should only be instantiated on the main thread! 
    4. Do not start Matplotlib GUI.
    5. Save the images in the 'assets' folder. 
    6. Must respond with code directly. 
    7. Do not try to make a code block. 
    8. Just output the python code in plain text.

    Code Guidelines:
    1. Always include
    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use('Agg')

    Guidelines:
    1. Do not include the punctuations at the starting or end.
    2. Do not include any starter text or header.
    3. Create the required image directory. Assume that it does not exist. 
    4. Successfully save the images to the required directory.
    5. Only create graphs wherever path to the image is defined in the markdown file. If not present, do not create a graph.

    IMPORTANT NOTE: IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE IMAGES INSERTED IN THE MARKDOWN, MAKE A GRAPH CORRESPONDING TO EACH IMAGE INSERTED BASED ON THE DATA NEAR IT.
    WRITE THE CODE SUCH THAT ALL THE IMAGES ARE SAVED AS DIFFERENT IMAGES WITH DESIGNATED NAMES BY RUNNING THE SINGLE PYTHON SCRIPT.
