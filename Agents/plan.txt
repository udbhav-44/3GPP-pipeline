### Chain of Thoughts (COT)

To address the query regarding the Technical Specifications and Technical Reports for an Evolved Packet System (EPS) based 3GPP system, I will break down the main task into several subtasks. Each subtask will focus on a specific aspect of the query, ensuring that the research is thorough and covers various dimensions of the topic.

1. **Understanding the Query**: The main task is to gather valid information about the Technical Specifications (TS) and Technical Reports (TR) related to the Evolved Packet System (EPS) in the context of the 3GPP system. This requires an examination of both the specifications and reports.

2. **Subtask Breakdown**:
   - **Task 1**: Fetch the latest Technical Specifications (TS) related to EPS from the 3GPP FTP server. This task is fundamental as it will provide the primary source of information regarding the technical specifications.
   - **Task 2**: Fetch the latest Technical Reports (TR) related to EPS from the 3GPP FTP server. Similar to Task 1, this will provide essential insights from the reports that accompany the specifications.
   - **Task 3**: Summarize the findings from Task 1 (Technical Specifications) to extract key information and insights.
   - **Task 4**: Summarize the findings from Task 2 (Technical Reports) to extract key information and insights.
   - **Task 5**: Compare and analyze the insights from Tasks 3 and 4 to highlight any discrepancies or unique findings between the specifications and reports.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Task 3 depends on the results of Task 1.
   - Task 4 depends on the results of Task 2.
   - Task 5 depends on the results of both Task 3 and Task 4.

4. **Local Constraints**: Each subtask will have specific local constraints, such as ensuring that the fetched documents are the most recent and relevant to EPS, and that the summaries are concise and focused on the key aspects of the specifications and reports.

5. **Global Constraints**: The main task must ensure that all information gathered is accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to the Evolved Packet System within the 3GPP framework.

With this breakdown, I will now populate the JSON template with the identified subtasks.
