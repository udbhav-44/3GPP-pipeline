### Chain of Thoughts (COT)

To address the query about the new MIMO specifications of 6G networks, we will break down the main task into several sub-tasks that focus on different aspects of MIMO technology and its specifications. Given the complexity of the topic, we will consider various dimensions such as technical specifications, research papers, industry standards, and regulatory considerations.

1. **Understanding MIMO in 6G Context**: The first sub-task will focus on gathering a broad understanding of what MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology entails in the context of 6G. This will involve a web search to identify foundational information and recent advancements.

2. **Research Papers on MIMO Specifications**: The second sub-task will involve fetching recent research papers from arXiv that specifically discuss new MIMO specifications in 6G. This will provide insights from academia and ongoing research efforts.

3. **3GPP Specifications**: The third sub-task will focus on obtaining relevant technical specifications from the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), which is crucial for understanding standardized MIMO specifications for 6G.

4. **Industry Trends and Applications**: The fourth sub-task will involve a web search to identify industry trends, applications, and practical implementations of MIMO technology in 6G networks.

5. **Summary of Findings**: Finally, a summarization task will compile the findings from the previous tasks to create a coherent overview of the new MIMO specifications in 6G networks.

Each sub-task is designed to be independent where possible, but the final summarization will depend on the results of the previous tasks.

### Local Constraints
- **Task 1**: The information gathered should focus specifically on MIMO technology as it relates to 6G, avoiding unrelated technologies.
- **Task 2**: Only papers published within the last two years should be considered to ensure the information is current.
- **Task 3**: The specifications fetched must be specifically related to MIMO technology in the context of 6G.
- **Task 4**: The search should focus on industry reports or articles published in reputable tech magazines or journals.
- **Task 5**: The summarization must include key points from all previous tasks and avoid duplicating information.

### Global Constraints
The global constraint for the main task is that all information must be up-to-date, relevant to MIMO specifications in 6G, and derived from credible sources.
