### Chain of Thoughts (COT)

The main task is to determine which college the user is from. This is a straightforward query that typically requires some form of search or retrieval of data. Given the tools available, we can approach this task by breaking it down into several subtasks, each focusing on a specific method of information retrieval.

1. **Initial Search for College Information**: The first subtask will involve performing a web search to find general information about the user's college. This will help establish a baseline of knowledge and potentially identify specific colleges that the user might be associated with.

2. **Wikipedia Summary Retrieval**: The second subtask will involve fetching a summary from Wikipedia based on the information gathered in the first task. This can provide a more structured and reliable source of information about the college.

3. **Detailed Web Scraping**: If the initial search yields a specific college, the next subtask will be to scrape detailed information from the relevant web page. This will provide comprehensive data about the college, including its programs, location, and other pertinent details.

4. **Document Retrieval**: If specific documents related to the user's college are available internally, we can query those documents for more accurate and verified information. This can serve as a secondary verification step.

5. **Final Synthesis of Information**: The last subtask will involve synthesizing the information gathered from the previous tasks to provide a clear answer to the user regarding which college they are from.

Each subtask is designed to be independent, with the exception of the web scraping task, which depends on the results of the initial search. The local constraints for each task will ensure that the agents focus on the specific aspects required for their subtasks.

### Global Constraints
The main task has the following global constraints:
- The information must be accurate and relevant to the user's query about their college.
- The subtasks must be executed in a manner that respects the dependencies outlined.
