### Chain of Thoughts (COT)

The user's query focuses on understanding the options supported for deactivating On-Demand SSB (OD-SSB) transmission from the User Equipment (UE) perspective. This task requires a multi-faceted approach, as it involves various domains such as communication technologies, 3GPP standardization, and network performance analysis. 

To break down this task into manageable subtasks, I will consider the following domains:

1. **3GPP Standardization**: Understanding the specific standards related to OD-SSB.
2. **Communication Technologies**: Exploring the technical options available for deactivating OD-SSB from the UE perspective.
3. **Network Performance Analysis**: Analyzing how these deactivation options affect network performance.
4. **Policy and Regulation**: Investigating any relevant policies or regulations that might impact the implementation of these options.

Each of these domains will be addressed through a separate subtask, with each subtask assigned to a specific agent who specializes in that area. I will ensure that the subtasks are granular and independent where possible, but I will also identify dependencies where necessary.

#### Subtasks Breakdown

1. **Task 1**: Research 3GPP standards related to OD-SSB deactivation options.
   - **Agent**: 3GPP Standards Specialist
   - **Agent Role Description**: The agent will analyze 3GPP documentation to extract relevant standards that outline the deactivation options for OD-SSB from the UE perspective.
   - **Tools**: `search_and_generate`
   - **Local Constraints**: Focus on 3GPP specifications published after 2020 that mention OD-SSB.
   - **Require Data**: None

2. **Task 2**: Investigate communication technologies that facilitate OD-SSB deactivation.
   - **Agent**: Communication Systems Researcher
   - **Agent Role Description**: The agent will explore various communication technologies that allow for the deactivation of OD-SSB from the UE perspective, detailing how these technologies function.
   - **Tools**: `search_and_generate`
   - **Local Constraints**: Look for technologies that have been implemented in commercial networks.
   - **Require Data**: None

3. **Task 3**: Analyze the impact of OD-SSB deactivation on network performance.
   - **Agent**: Network Performance Analyst
   - **Agent Role Description**: The agent will evaluate how the deactivation of OD-SSB affects overall network performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and user experience.
   - **Tools**: `search_and_generate`
   - **Local Constraints**: Focus on performance studies conducted in the last two years.
   - **Require Data**: None

4. **Task 4**: Examine policy and regulatory considerations for OD-SSB deactivation.
   - **Agent**: Regulatory Analyst
   - **Agent Role Description**: The agent will investigate any policies or regulations that govern the implementation of OD-SSB deactivation options from the perspective of telecommunications regulations.
   - **Tools**: `search_and_generate`
   - **Local Constraints**: Identify regulations that have been enacted or updated in the last year.
   - **Require Data**: None

### Global Constraints
- The overall task is constrained by the need to ensure that all gathered information is current, relevant, and directly applicable to the deactivation of OD-SSB from the UE perspective.
