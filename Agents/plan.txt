### Chain of Thoughts (COT)

To tackle the user query "What do you know?", I need to gather comprehensive information about the capabilities and functionalities of the tools at our disposal. The task can be broken down into subtasks focusing on different aspects of the tools, ensuring a multi-dimensional approach.

1. **Understanding Tool Capabilities**: The first subtask will involve using the `get_wikipedia_summary` tool to fetch a summary of the tools available. This will provide a foundational understanding of what tools we have and their general functionalities.

2. **Detailed Tool Functionality**: The second subtask will utilize the `web_search` tool to find detailed descriptions of each tool's capabilities. This will help in understanding the specific functions and limitations of the tools available.

3. **Comparative Analysis of Tools**: The third subtask will involve analyzing the information gathered from the first two subtasks to compare the tools' functionalities and determine which is best suited for various tasks.

4. **Global Constraints**: The main task's global constraint will be that all information must be accurate and derived from reliable sources, ensuring that the gathered knowledge reflects the most current and relevant information.

### Subtask Breakdown

1. **Subtask 1**: Fetch a summary of the tools using `get_wikipedia_summary`.
   - **Local Constraints**: The summary must be relevant to the tools available for task management.
   - **Require Data**: None.

2. **Subtask 2**: Conduct a web search to find detailed descriptions of the tools.
   - **Local Constraints**: The search results must focus on reliable sources that provide comprehensive details about the tools.
   - **Require Data**: None.

3. **Subtask 3**: Analyze the information from Subtask 1 and Subtask 2 to compare the tools.
   - **Local Constraints**: The analysis must be based on the summaries and details obtained from the previous tasks.
   - **Require Data**: ["task_1", "task_2"].

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "main_task": "Gather valid information about the tools available for task management.",
    "sub_tasks": {
        "task_1": {
            "content": "Fetch a summary of the tools available for task management using the get_wikipedia_summary tool.",

            "agent_role_description": "A researcher who specializes in gathering and summarizing information from various sources, particularly Wikipedia.",
            "tools": ["get_wikipedia_summary"],
            "local_constraints": ["The summary must be relevant to the tools available for task management."],
            "require_data": []
        },
        "task_2": {
            "content": "Conduct a web search to find detailed descriptions of the tools available for task management.",
            "agent": "Data Collection Agent",
            "agent_role_description": "An agent responsible for gathering detailed information from the web, focusing on relevant and reliable sources.",
            "tools": ["web_search"],
            "local_constraints": ["The search results must focus on reliable sources that provide comprehensive details about the tools."],
            "require_data": []
        },
        "task_3": {
            "content": "Analyze the information from task_1 and task_2 to compare the functionalities of the tools available for task management.",
            "agent": "Data Interpreter",
            "agent_role_description": "An agent who specializes in interpreting and analyzing data from various sources to provide comparative insights.",
            "tools": [],
            "local_constraints": ["The analysis must be based on the summaries and details obtained from the previous tasks."],
            "require_data": ["task_1", "task_2"]
        }
    }
}
``` 

This structured approach ensures that we comprehensively gather and analyze information about the tools available for task management, leveraging the unique capabilities of each tool effectively.
