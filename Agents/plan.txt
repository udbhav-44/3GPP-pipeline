### Chain of Thoughts (COT)

To address the user’s query regarding options for deactivating On-Demand SSB (Synchronization Signal Block) transmission from the User Equipment (UE) perspective, we need to break down the task into manageable subtasks. This requires a multi-dimensional approach, focusing on specific domains such as communication technologies, 3GPP standardization, and network performance analysis.

1. **Understanding the Main Task**: The main task is to gather valid information on the options available for deactivating OD-SSB transmission from the UE perspective. This involves exploring technical documents, standards, and research related to SSB operations.

2. **Identifying Subtasks**:
   - **Subtask 1**: Investigate the general options available for deactivating SSB from the UE perspective. This will involve searching for technical documents or standards that outline these options.
   - **Subtask 2**: Explore specific 3GPP standards related to OD-SSB and their implications for UE operation. This will require detailed research into the 3GPP documents.
   - **Subtask 3**: Analyze the network performance implications of deactivating OD-SSB from the UE perspective. This will look into how this affects network efficiency and user experience.
   - **Subtask 4**: Review any existing policies or regulations that may influence the implementation of OD-SSB deactivation. This involves understanding regulatory constraints and guidelines.

3. **Dependencies**: Each subtask operates independently, meaning they can be executed in parallel. However, the results of Subtask 1 might inform Subtask 2, as understanding the general options can help contextualize the specific standards.

4. **Local Constraints**: Each subtask will have its unique local constraints based on the focus area. For example, Subtask 1 may be limited to recent documents or specific technical specifications, while Subtask 3 may need to focus on performance metrics.

5. **Global Constraints**: The overall task is constrained by the need for up-to-date and relevant information that specifically addresses the deactivation of OD-SSB from the UE perspective.

Based on this analysis, I will now populate the JSON template with the identified subtasks.
