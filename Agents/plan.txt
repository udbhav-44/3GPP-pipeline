### Chain of Thoughts (COT)

To address the user query regarding summarizing the latest RAN meeting outcomes for Release 18, we need to break down the task into several sub-tasks that focus on specific domains and utilize the available tools effectively. The main task is complex and requires gathering information from different sources, ensuring a comprehensive summary.

1. **Understanding the Main Task**: The main task is to summarize the outcomes of the latest RAN meeting for Release 18. This involves collecting information from various documents and possibly querying specific meeting outcomes.

2. **Identifying Sub-Tasks**: Given the complexity of the main task, I will create sub-tasks that focus on specific aspects:
   - **Task 1**: Querying documents related to the latest RAN meeting outcomes.
   - **Task 2**: Summarizing the outcomes from the documents retrieved in Task 1.
   - **Task 3**: Fetching a summary from Wikipedia about Release 18 to provide contextual information.

3. **Dependencies**: 
   - Task 2 depends on the results of Task 1, as it requires the documents retrieved to summarize the outcomes.
   - Task 3 is independent and can be executed concurrently.

4. **Local Constraints**: Each sub-task will have specific local constraints to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information gathered.

5. **Global Constraints**: The overall task must ensure that all gathered information is up-to-date and relevant to Release 18.

Now, I will structure the identified sub-tasks into the specified JSON format.

```json
{
    "main_task": "Summarize the latest RAN meeting outcomes for Release 18.",
    "sub_tasks": {
        "task_1": {
            "content": "Query documents to retrieve the latest outcomes from the RAN meeting related to Release 18.",
            "agent": "Communication Systems Researcher",
            "agent_role_description": "The researcher specializes in communication systems and standards, focusing on gathering relevant documents and information from meetings.",
            "tools": ["search_and_generate"],
            "local_constraints": ["Only include documents from the latest RAN meeting that are specifically related to Release 18."],
            "require_data": []
        },
        "task_2": {
            "content": "Based on the documents retrieved in task_1, summarize the key outcomes of the latest RAN meeting.",
            "agent": "Technical Documentation Specialist",
            "agent_role_description": "The specialist is responsible for analyzing technical documents and synthesizing key information into concise summaries.",
            "tools": ["retrieve_documents"],
            "local_constraints": ["Ensure the summary captures the main points and decisions made during the RAN meeting for Release 18."],
            "require_data": ["task_1"]
        },
        "task_3": {
            "content": "Fetch a summary from Wikipedia about Release 18 to provide additional context to the meeting outcomes.",
            "agent": "Market Researcher",
            "agent_role_description": "The researcher focuses on gathering market and technology trends, providing context to the outcomes of meetings through external sources.",
            "tools": ["get_wikipedia_summary"],
            "local_constraints": ["The summary must be relevant to Release 18 and should reflect the latest information available."],
            "require_data": []
        }
    }
}
``` 

This structured approach allows for parallel execution of independent tasks while ensuring that dependent tasks are executed in the correct order, leading to a comprehensive summary of the RAN meeting outcomes for Release 18.
